netty and protobuf for the transport and serialization.

Your task is to get the code to build and run through
two terminals (a client and a server).

Technologies introduced:
1. Netty
2. Protobuf
3. JAXB

    upstream sockets {
        server 127.0.0.1:8080;

    }

    server {
        listen 8020;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://sockets;
